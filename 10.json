In this final book, the two storylines from the second book are continued. In the first, the {{3}} Hobbits are reunited with their companions and {{4}} who was thought lost. Then they get split up again, {{4}} taking Pippin to Gondor, and the rest {{6}} with the Rohirim the long way to Gondor. Along the way to Gondor, three of them get diverted through the Paths of the {{7}}. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are being guided up the winding {{8}} by {{9}}. They then enter a cave, where a giant {{10}} attacks Frodo. He wakes up in a tower, then is {{11}} by Sam. They then continue on towards Mt. Doom. Back in the other story line, the three friends have recruited ghosts to help battle the {{12}} in Gondor. As they are nearing defeat, Frodo and Sam reach Mt Doom. There, Frodo decides not to throw the {{1}} into the {{14}}. However, {{9}} bites his {{16}} off, and falls in taking it with him. In the end, the remaining members of the fellowship are reunited, and Aragorn is crowned {{2}} of Gondor."
